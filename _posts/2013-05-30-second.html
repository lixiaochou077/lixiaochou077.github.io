title: Custom 404 Pages
---
If you provide a 404.html file in the root of your repository, it will be served instead of the default 404 page. Note that Jekyll-generated pages will not work,<!-- more --> it must be an html file.

Custom 404s only work when they are served from the root of a Pages domain, for example a project using a custom domain or a user pages repository. A custom 404 page on project pages that are not using a custom domain will not work.
